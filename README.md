## Introduction

Applications of clustering include customer segmentation, data analysis, anomaly detection, image segmentation. Customer segmentation is widely used to divide customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately. This project demonstrates Hierarchical Clustering (AgglomerativeClustering), DBScan and Gaussian Mixtures Model (GMM) clustering techniques for segmentation of bank's customer data.

Another application of clustering is image compression, which is also known as color quantization. In simple words, the idea is to represent an image using a fewer number of colors (hence achieving a compression). The notebook demonstrates image compression using K-mean clustering.
